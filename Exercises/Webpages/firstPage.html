    <!--Added two paragraphs and nested a list into the last paragraph-->
        <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy reading the odd book or two. I mainly read Manga and Manhwa, which in simple terms are types of comic books and/or cartooning in general. They each have their distinctive difference in the art styles used however the main difference being that each originated in a particular country. Those being <em>Japan</em> and <em>South Korea</em>respectively.

        <h2><span class="underline">Watching movies:</span></h2>
    <!--Added two paragraphs-->
        <p>Similiarly to my passion for reading, I love watching movies. The main genres I watch are romance, comedy and action. In that oreder yes.</p>
        <p>Many a times I find myself going back to rewatch films I already watched.</p>
    <h1 class="heading">Goals</h1>
        <h2><span class="underline">Growth:</span></h2>
        <!--Added two paragraphs-->
        <p>By the end of my 6 months at Life Choices I would like to look back and see the extent to which I have developed as an individual.</p>
        <p>I would like to reflect on the time spent on Life Choices and use it as a reference to base my futher journey into coding on.</p>
        <h2><span class="underline">Try my best:</span></h2>
        <!--Added two paragraphs-->
        <p>The 6 month journey ahead will be a <em>challenge</em> Ill have to overcome. The only thing I want is to <style>remain firm in is my resolve to not give up halfway through.</style></p>
        <p>It seems easier said then done. As I find myself overwhelmed by the pace at which content is coveredd and how we as the canidates are expected to retain that information. This will however be a <strong>small chapter in a greater story to come.</strong></p>
